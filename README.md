Hey there! ðŸ˜œ

Introductions are weird, but let's try! 

Im Brenton, a (soon to be) full stack developer with a background in design and sales. On paper, my background is people development and sales, but I've never been one to fit perfectly in one box. Having a learning and growth mindset has always driven me to expand my communication and leadership skills.

That natural momentum hasn't stopped as I have made my way through Web Development and Coding programs with the University of Sydney. Focusing on HTML, CSS JavaScript, jQuery, react.js and node.js my aim is to blend them with my existing knowledge of the fundamentals of colour, design and typography and my preparedness to put in the hard yards to make to make accessible, engaging web applications that enrich people's lives.
